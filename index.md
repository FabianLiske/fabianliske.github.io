## The Importance of Medical AI

The healthcare sector is under increasing pressure: populations are aging, chronic diseases are on the rise, and many regions face a shortage of medical specialists — particularly in fields like radiology, pathology, and oncology. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a powerful way to help close this gap. AI systems can analyze medical images, genomic data, or electronic health records at scale, supporting physicians in diagnosing diseases earlier and more accurately, triaging patients, and even predicting treatment responses.

In areas with limited access to expert care, AI can act as a virtual second opinion or a diagnostic assistant, helping to reduce disparities in healthcare quality. Moreover, AI can handle time-consuming tasks, such as image annotation or documentation, freeing up valuable time for direct patient interaction.

But while the potential of AI in medicine is widely recognized, its implementation is often slowed. As healthcare is inherently decentralized, data is usually decentralized as well. Data privacy regulations and ethical concerns also hinder the creation of large, centralized datasets for training medical AI models. Swarm Learning offers a promising solution to these challenges - enabling collaborative AI development without the need to share raw patient data.

## What is Swarm Learning

In conventional machine learning, especially in healthcare, models are often trained on data that has been centralized — typically collected and stored in large data centers or cloud platforms. While this setup can be effective, it raises major concerns around data privacy, ownership, and compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.

### Local Learning

Every participant can create their own model using their own data (Fig 1a). However this will result in worse models if the amount of data ervery participant has is insufficient, but no data has to be shared.

### Centralized Learning

If all data can be centralized the training of a model can also be performed on a central copmute resource, for example in the cloud (Fig 1b). This typically results in better performance than locally trained models.

### Federated Learning

Federated Learnign (FL, Fig 1c) combines Local and Centralized Learning. The models are trained locally on locally stored data and the resulting model parameters are stored on a centralized server. While the users don't need to share their data centrally, there remains a central authority managing the model.

### Swarm Learning

Swarm Learning (SL, Fig 1d) aims to resolve the final issue with FL by removing the cetral authority. Instead of sharing the model parameters and merging them on the central server the paramters are merged to a shared model and distributed fairly via blockchain.
